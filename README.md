Here is my first real 'Project' for The Odin Project. It's nice getting to know my way around Linux and Ubuntu, as well as using the command line more than I have before. 

I'm going to assume this is a project where I'll try to copy the HTML and CSS of the Google Homepage. Let's see how it goes. 

UPDATE Oct. 31/2019 - I finished styling the homepage. I think I did a pretty great job, although it's not responsive - The project only asked to recreate the page using the logo and search bar, etc. I think I did a great job of achieving that. 

Next up, I'll be styling the Search Results page for soem more HTML and CSS practice.
